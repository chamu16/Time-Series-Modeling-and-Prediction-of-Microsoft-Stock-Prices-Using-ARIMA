# Time-Series-Modeling-and-Prediction-of-Microsoft-Stock-Prices-Using-ARIMA-Feb


## Introduction

This project aims to develop an accurate time series model for predicting the historical closing prices of Microsoft stock. By employing the ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) modeling approach, the inherent patterns and seasonality present in the stock price data are captured, enabling reliable predictions within the given time frame.

## Objectives

The primary goal of this project is to leverage ARIMA modeling techniques to effectively analyze and forecast the historical closing prices of Microsoft stock. This involves performing exploratory data analysis, assessing stationarity, fitting various ARIMA model configurations, evaluating model performance, and ultimately predicting historical prices based on the best-performing model.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Import libraries, load the dataset, handle missing values/outliers, and preprocess date formats.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualize trends, seasonality, analyze summary statistics, and perform decomposition.
3. **Stationarity Testing**: Apply ADF and KPSS tests, and apply necessary transformations to achieve stationarity.
4. **ARIMA Model Building**: Examine ACF/PACF plots, manually fit ARIMA models, and utilize auto-ARIMA for model selection.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assess performance using statistical measures, diagnostic tests on residuals, and check for heteroskedasticity.
6. **Prediction and Visualization**: Predict historical closing prices using the best model and visualize against actual values.

## Results and Discussion

●	The ARIMA modeling approach has proven effective in capturing the time series dynamics of Microsoft stock prices.

●	By leveraging techniques such as decomposition, stationarity testing, and model selection criteria, this project demonstrates the process of building accurate time series models for historical prediction, providing insights for investment strategies and decision-making related to Microsoft stock.
